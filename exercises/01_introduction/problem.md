01 Introduction to WebGL with three.js
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the world of WebGL & Three.js! 

WebGL is now supported in all major browsers and mobile support is increasing thus making it an excellent choice for developing games, visualizations & cool effects. 

Before we can start creating the next TitanFall there are a few basics we will need to understand. 

These exercises will introduce you to many of the basics you need to put together something more complex (and interesting!).

By the end of this workshop you will understand the following:

*	Three.js coordinate system
*	Primitives such as lighting & materials
*	How to move the camera and objects
*	How to resize and rotate objects
*	How to load a textured 3d model
*	How to detect mouse clicks on an object

Sample code
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the assets folder you will find 3 other folders:

* Boilerplate App - All three.js scenes require a bit of setup - a scene, camera, lighting & rendering loop. This app sets up a simple scene and is a good template to use for the exercises
* Boilerplate physics - this setups a simple scene & the physics engine physijs (exercise 7)
* Goose model - a textured 3d model Goose (exercise 5)
* Game example - simple balancing game using physisjs physics engine

No verification

Unlike some other workshopper courses such as learnyounode there is no verification step with three.js exercises - if it doesnt appear its probably not working!
